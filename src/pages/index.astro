    author={'Hello, my name is Iuliana.
I'm a February Child, born 1976 in Sibiu, Romania. I have an Veterinary assistant degree. Since 2003, my husband and I live in three places: Spain, Germany and Romania.
In 2009 I met Willi Mayerhofer in CÃ´te d'Azur. His paintings and his words motivated me to start to paint. So, I let my creativity flow, being inspired from the sunlight of Mallorca - ("La Isla de la Luz") a light, that makes the colours more intensive as in any other place.
What started as a hobby, it is now a Passion. Step by step I explore the world of abstract painting, trying different techniques, having a lot of joy and relaxation. It's a beautiful world, full of colours, free and without boundarys. It's my Infinity.'}
